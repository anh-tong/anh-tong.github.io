Mean-field games are introduced to me by my old labmate. After spending some time reading related materials, I decided to write a quick note on this topic.

The occasion is that we reviewed a multi-armed bandit game paper that uses the mean-field game approach. The common goal of a multi-armed bandit problem is to devise a strategy (which arm to play) to maximize future rewards. The algorithm I got to know is upper-confident bound (UCB) which is obtained from the statistics of history of intermediate rewards. Here, I am a little digressed from the purpose of this post which is about mean-field games.
