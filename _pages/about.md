My name is Anh Tong (Tống Hoàng Anh). I'm currently a Postdoctoral researcher at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) working with [Prof. Jaesik Choi](http://sailab.kaist.ac.kr/members/jaesik/). My research interests includes probabilistic machine learning methods. My Ph.D. thesis studies model selection problems for Gaussian processes in relational learning settings for time series modeling, extending to scalable paradigm. 

Recently, I'm focusing on some aspects in mathematical finance where some tools like stochastic process, White Noise Theory, Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) play the central roles.
