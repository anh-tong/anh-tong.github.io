My name is Anh Tong. I'm currently a Postdoctoral researcher at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) working with [Prof. Jaesik Choi](http://sailab.kaist.ac.kr/members/jaesik/). My research interests include probabilistic machine learning methods, Gaussian processes. My Ph.D. thesis studies model selection problems for Gaussian processes in relational learning settings for time series modeling, extending to scalable paradigm. 

Recently, I'm exploring a broader aspect of mathematical tools like Stochastic Analysis, Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) and more.
