My name is Anh Tong. I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Korea University (visit our lab website [https://sdml-ku.github.io/](here)). Before joining Korea University, I was a postdoc researcher at KAIST. I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) working with [Prof. Jaesik Choi](http://sailab.kaist.ac.kr/members/jaesik/). My research interests include probabilistic machine learning methods, Gaussian processes. My Ph.D. thesis studies model selection problems for Gaussian processes in relational learning settings for time series modeling, extending to scalable paradigm. 

Recently, I'm exploring a broader aspect of mathematical tools like Stochastic Analysis, Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE).
